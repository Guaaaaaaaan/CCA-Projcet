            <p>Lycoris Recoil (Japanese: リコリス・リコイル, Hepburn: Rikorisu Rikoiru) is a Japanese original anime 
            television series created by Spider Lily and Asaura. It is produced by A-1 Pictures and aired from July to September 2022.</p>
            
                <h2>Plot</h2>


            <p><a href="GuanJie's_Takina_Inoue.html"><strong>Takina Inoue</strong></a> is a member of a government-sponsored all-female task force of assassins and spies made up of orphans known as 
                "Lycoris", an undercover group (named after the flower) who eliminate criminals and terrorists in Tokyo while disguised as 
                high school students to maintain peace against World War III in Japan, with roots in a fictional pre-Meiji group named 
                "Higanbana".However, during an operation to intercept a large exchange of firearms, she starts firing indiscriminately 
                at the enemies in order to save a colleague that was taken as hostage, jeopardizing the safety of other Lycoris in the process. 
                As a result, the agency dismissed her for disobeying orders. She was then transferred to work with an elite Lycoris agent 
                <a href="GuanJie's_Chisato_Nishikigi.html"><strong>Chisato Nishikigi</strong></a>, who is known for her involvement in the destruction of 
                the old radio tower, on a branch of the agency that operates undercover as a café called "LycoReco". Intending to be reinstated 
                back to the agency, Takina cooperates with Chisato on managing the café, while the peace that is being protected by the Lycoris 
                is being challenged by terrorists led by Majima.</p>
